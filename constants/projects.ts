      "Diarist is a digital diary for capturing thoughts, tracking moods, and setting future goals. With daily journaling, a Time Capsule feature, Diarist helps you reflect, grow, and keep memories safe—all in one place.",

    why: "I built Diarist because I believe many of us struggle with late-night thoughts—whether it's overthinking, self-doubt, or stress. When I started reflecting on my day before bed, it helped me realize my progress and gave me peace of mind. I wanted to create something that helps others do the same.",

    solves:

It helps users reduce stress and overthinking, improve mental clarity, and track their personal growth over time. By offering features like mood tracking and goal setting, Diarist supports mental well-being and fosters self-improvement.",
